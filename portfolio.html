            <h4><b>AutoSim</b></h4>
            <h3>A Racing Video Game</h3>
            <p>AutoSim is a game I have been developing since March of 2020. A fully immersive AI-driven racing management simulator, AutoSim takes players into the business of auto racing. Start a team or inherit a pre-exiting team, hire drivers, upgrade your cars, and compete for the championship. Or, go hands off and simulate a what-if scenario up to 60 years using historical rosters. The extensive mod-friendly approach to this game allows users to get the most out of their experience. The possibilities are limitless with AutoSim. </p>

            <h3>My First Website</h3>
            <p>In my MI349 Website Design class, my first major assignment was to create a blog-styled website. I have a passion for football, basketball, and auto racing, so I decided to create a sports style blog. While the concept might be a few years too old, it was a great exercise that taught me a lot about HTML and CSS. </p>
